This repo will hold code used in Fall Byrne Seminar'25: Applied Machine Learning for Engaged Health Research

Professors: Charles Senteio and Tawfiq Ammari (Library and Information Science)

Description: Around the world, urban healthcare systems struggle to provide equitable care, and these disparities are often reflected in the language used in clinical documentation. This course introduces how applied machine learning can help address systemic inequities by uncovering biases in data and the computational methods used to analyze it. Using a current research project focusing on Brazilian Nursing Notes as a case study, students will examine how collaboration between researchers and healthcare providers across continents fosters impactful, community-engaged scholarship.
